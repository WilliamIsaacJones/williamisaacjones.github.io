  <h3>
    Mathematics For Everyone:
  </h3>


  <p> The below axioms have been copied from Federica Ardila's website, as I agree that they need to be placed where they can be read
    and followed. They were first written in <i> Todos Cuentan</i>, an article he wrote for Notices of the AMS.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Axiom 1:</b> <i>Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Axiom 2:</b> <i>Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Axiom 3:</b> <i>Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Axiom 4:</b> <i>Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.</i>
  </p>

    Last, a picture of a beautiful riff on my favorite flower, for all to enjoy.

    
  </h3>
  <p>I spent a lot of time in my youth hiking the ridges of New York State, where rhododendron are fairly common. Their blooms vary between pink and white, so imagine 
    my surprise when I discovered a cousin  with yellow blossoms preserved at the New York Botanical Gardens!
