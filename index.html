<h1>
  Welcome To My Website!
</h1>

<p>
  This is the personal/academic website of William Jones (he/him/his), a mathematics Ph.D. student at Tufts University (as of Fall 2023).
  <b>It is a work in progress</b>, and all opinions expressed inside are his and his alone.
</p><p>
  I'm keeping this as a place to be my digital record of several kinds: as a student, a mathematician, and a human in a community. 
  I'll be updating this website more as time passes, but one thing I'm interested in experimenting with is the idea of a <i>mathematical journal</i>, 
  a home for my mathematical musings. If you're curious about the vision behind it, follow the link!
</p>

    Mathematics For Everyone:
  </h3>

  <p> I subscribe to the belief that mathematics is a universal source of joy and meaning, and that all who wish to learn have the right to do so.
    There are many ways to engage with this belief, and I thank every person who has taken the time to
    discuss and think through what this belief means, and the difference between current educational structures
    and those structures which the belief entails. I find Federico Ardila's clear-eyed outline of this 
    belief to be particularly inspiring:
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Axiom 1:</b> <i>Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Axiom 2:</b> <i>Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Axiom 3:</b> <i>Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Axiom 4:</b> <i>Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.</i>
  </p>

    Last, a picture of my favorite flower, for all to enjoy.
