<h1>My Lecture Notes</h1>
<p>The following is a list of various notes I have made, from classes (and perhaps individual study in the future, if I 
  can find time to polish my personal notes). I have also put explanations next to the links for the interested reader,
  describing my background at the time of writing and the style of writing. As always, email me for major mistakes (which are
  most certainly present in these hasty notes).

<p><a href="pdfs/modalg2spring2022.pdf" download="newfilename">Modern Algebra II Spring 2022, Binghamton University</a>. These 
notes were written when I was a senior at my undergrad, and cover a semester (half-year) long course. Topics
can be found in the table of contents, but the course can be described as a pleasant stroll through the basics
of linear algebra, representation theory, module theory, and field theory. I intended these notes to be 
as elementary as possible, and were written with a very basic background in algebra (and a basic background in TeX formatting;
 the typesetting is not as nice as I would like it to be.) VER 3</p>
